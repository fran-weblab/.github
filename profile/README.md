# Web Lab

Welcome to **Web Lab**, an experimental playground for web development ideas, prototypes, and creative builds.  
This is where concepts turn into code — from small experiments to full-scale clones.

## Objectives
- Explore innovative web technologies and frameworks.
- Create **clones** of popular websites and apps to learn their architecture and best practices.
- Build proof-of-concepts quickly, focusing on learning and iteration.
- Document findings and lessons learned for future reference.

## Structure
Projects in this organization are organized by type:
- **Clones** – Replicas of real-world platforms for study and practice.
- **Experiments** – Tests of new tools, APIs, or unconventional design approaches.
- **Prototypes** – Early versions of potential larger projects.

> **Note:** All projects are for educational and experimental purposes only.
